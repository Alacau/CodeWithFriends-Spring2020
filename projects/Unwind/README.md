## Summary

Unwind is a personal project that I've been planning to do for awhile. Although it is currently unfinished at the time of submission, I'm going to continue working on it and hopefully submit it to the AppStore this summer!

## Inspiration

I love to make apps and this is one of the apps I've been planning to do for awhile.

## Challenges

It was hard balancing school, extracurriculars, family, and this project. I had a lot going on at once but I managed to get everything done by sacrificing some leisure time to myself.

## Reflections

I learned a lot about what I can do on my own without the need of tutorials all that much. I also learned that I'm capable of being productive and I should watch out for when I need to take breaks and practice self care.
