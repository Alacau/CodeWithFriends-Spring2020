# Make Ur Kreations Online (M.U.K.O.) - May 2020
Welcome to **MUKO May 2020**! Whether you're home from school or working from home, we all have a lot more free time on our hands in this time of social distancing. This is a great chance to learn something new, or to tackle that project that has been on your mind forever. Let's take advantage of all of this new found time and make some cool stuff!

## Theme
No fair is complete without a theme right? With all of us shut away in our homes, what better theme than **Quarantine Improvement**? Build something, anything, multiple things that will improve your quarantine life. Maybe you've been spending too much time milling around and need a pomodoro timer to keep you on track, or maybe you need a way to keep track of your online spending due to cabin fever.
