# Make Ur Kreations Online (M.U.K.O.) - May 2020
Welcome to **MUKO May 2020**! Whether you're home from school or working from home, we all have a lot more free time on our hands in this time of social distancing. This is a great chance to learn something new, or to tackle that project that has been on your mind forever. Let's take advantage of all of this new found time and make some cool stuff!

## Theme
No fair is complete without a theme right? With all of us shut away in our homes, what better theme than **Quarantine Improvement**? Build something, anything, multiple things that will improve your quarantine life. Maybe you've been spending too much time milling around and need a pomodoro timer to keep you on track, or maybe you need a way to keep track of your online spending due to cabin fever.

## Entry Submission
You have until **Friday May 29th** to submit your projects.

### To submit a project

2. Add a directory under the `projects/` directory named after your git user.
```

### So what do I do if my project isn't code?!?!?
That's a great question. Document what you're doing via git! Add some markdown files to log your progress, or upload pictures/videos that give us an idea of what you're building and how it's going!

## Examples
- Deej hates it when a song he doesn't to listen to starts to play while he's in the shower. He decides to make a waterproof bluetooth **next** button that he can hang from his shower head.
- Scott wants to track his ongoing projects but doesn't want to buy a subscription to use Asana or JIRA. He decides to build a task tracker!
