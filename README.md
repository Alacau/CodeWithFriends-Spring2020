# helloFair May 2020
Welcome to the **helloFair May 2020**! This quarantine period is a great time to learn something new or to tackle that project that has been on your mind forever. So lets take advantage of all of this new found time and make something out of it!

## Theme
No maker fair is complete without a theme right? With all of us locked away in our homes, what better theme than **Quarantine Improvement**? Build something, anything, whether that be software, hardware or learning to make toilet paper, build something that will improve your quarantine life.

## Timeline
- Start Date: **May 1st, 2020**
- Project Submissions: **May 29th, 2020**
- Silly Community Awards Voting: **May 30th-31st, 2020**

Mayuko will host weekly work sessions between **May 1, 2020** and **May 29, 2020** on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/hellomayuko) where we'll work on projects, and get help via [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/bpHFFWx) from one another.

## Entry Submission
You have until **May 29th** to submit your projects.

### To submit a project
1. [Fork this repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
2. Add a directory under the `projects/` directory named after your git user.
```
-> projects/
  -> ScottKwang/
    -> ...
    -> project files here
    -> ...
  -> helloMayuko/
    -> ...

-> README.md
```
3. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

### So what do I do if my project isn't code?!?!?
That's a great question. Document what you're doing via git! Add some markdown files to log your progress, or upload pictures/videos that give us an idea of what you're building and how it's going!

## Examples
- Deej hates it when a song he doesn't to listen to starts to play while he's in the shower. He decides to make a waterproof bluetooth **next** button that he can hang from his shower head.
- Scott wants to track his ongoing projects but doesn't want to buy a subscription to use Asana or JIRA. He decides to build a task tracker!
