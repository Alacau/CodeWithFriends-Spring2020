# Code With Friends - Spring 2020
**Learn new things! Make cool stuff! Have fun! Do all that, with an online community of friends.**

Welcome to **Code With Friends - Spring 2020**! 
This is the first of its kind, run by Mayuko Inoue and Scott Kwang. Whether you're home from school or working from home, we all have a lot more free time on our hands in this time of social distancing. This is a great chance to learn something new, or to tackle that project that has been on your mind forever. 

This is not a competition, nor a hackathon - think of it more as a month long science fair, where at the end we'll all be able to see and marvel at each other's creations. Make things at your own pace and be proud of what you've learned and made in the course of a month!

Now let's take advantage of all of this new found time and make some cool stuff!

## Theme
No event is complete without a theme right? With all of us shut away in our homes, what better theme than **Quarantine Improvement**? Build something, anything, multiple things that will improve your quarantine life. Maybe you've been spending too much time milling around and need a pomodoro timer to keep you on track, or maybe you need a way to keep track of your online spending due to cabin fever.

### Examples
Here are some examples of projects that you could work on during the event!
- Deej hates it when a song he doesn't to listen to starts to play while he's in the shower. He decides to make a waterproof bluetooth **next** button that he can hang from his shower head.
- Scott wants to track his ongoing projects but doesn't want to buy a subscription to use Asana or JIRA. He decides to build a task tracker!

### To submit a project

## Community
One of the core tenants of this event is the community! We want everyone to help, support, and get excited about each other's projects. The more people we have participating in the community, the more fun it will be!

#### Discord
Join our [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/bpHFFWx) server and check out the **Code With Friends** category. There'll be channels where people can mingle and ask each other for help.

#### Weekly Check-ins
Every Sunday evening, we'll check in to the `#check-ins` channel on Discord to record what we've been working on, and what's next. Think of this as a standup update! This is great for accountability, and will be an easy way to ask others for help and keep everyone up to date on how things are going.

#### Coworking Sessions
Mayuko will be hosting co-working sessions every Friday and Saturday from [1-4PM](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=1PM&tz=San%20Francisco&), where she'll be working on her own project and play some chillhop music to work to. Come hang out to co-work and hang out in the chat!
